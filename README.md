# Corona-map

It is a Simple website which tracks the covid-19 cases using visual representation of different color pointers. we can give different conditions to code i.e which color to show when certain number of case crosses. As in this program I had given only two conditions and two colors for representation.

It is a not a real time api data which we are getting from any api, it's a dummy data in json format and I am using this data to check for the conditions (if cases >255 then show red pointer else black ).

Using this concept we can implement it with real time API.
